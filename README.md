* Jessica recommended [Ghibliapi films](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films/)

* I used my old assignments, Youtuber [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfMkdvN-23o&t=0s)

* When i created the refresh button i forgot to declare the button with const.

* I Kept getting this error `ReferenceError: reloadButton is not defined
    at fetchData (index.js:32:1)`

* I figured it out and declared it with const.

* Thanks to Jessica for hinting at that.

* struggled with getting the refresh button to refresh without refreshing the whole page.

* I created a class called 'refresh' in HTML

* I Used `document.querySelector` selected element in html.

* With `addEventListener` and `endpoint` i fixed it.

* Thanks to Patrick's great explanation i was able
to make the page refresh only content not the whole page.
